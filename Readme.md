### Short Description

This repo shows an "extreme" case in which
entity model class, database context class, migration class,
user-secrets data and migration startup each is put in a separate project.

It might be partially useful for you! 


### `template` folder


- `MyContext.TheContext.cs` for project that keeps database context  
- `MyModel.TheModel.cs` for project that keeps entity model class
- `MyMigrationTarget.Empty.cs` for project that keeps migration classes generated by EFCore's migration tool 
- `MyMigrationStartupFactory.Startup.cs` for project that initiates migration
- `MyUserSecret.Empty` for project that keeps user-secrets.

### Batch files

- `generate.bat` to generate all projects and put them into a single solution `Test`.
- `destroy.bat` to delete all generated project and Sqlite database. SqlServer database is not deleted.
- `migration.bat` to initiate migration.
- `update.bat` to apply migration to database or generate database if it does not exist.
